CS6350 Big Data Management Assignment 1 Part 1 and 2 Readme

Part 1

I built the jar file the same way the lab assignments were built using Maven
and including the necessary libraries in the pom.xml file.
First we copy the hw1-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar onto our account on the CS6360 cluster
and make sure the folder assignment1 exists in the hdfs user directory.
If it doesn't exist we create one using the: hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/<netid>/assignment1
The program decompresses the text files onto the directory:

hdfs://user/<netid>/assignment1

using the command:
hadoop jar <jar name> <package name.class name.java file>

so in our case it is:
hadoop jar hw1-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar CS6350HW1.hw1.HW1pt1

The program copies the bz2 files onto the hdfs cluster, decompresses the txt files,
and deletes the bz2 files afterwards.

Part 2

The second part basically implements the same functionalities as part 1 except now 
we are doing it for zip files and the execution command changes to

hadoop jar hw1-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar CS6350HW1.hw1.HW1pt2

This unzips the text.txt file inside the zip to the assignment1 folder on the
hadoop cluster.
